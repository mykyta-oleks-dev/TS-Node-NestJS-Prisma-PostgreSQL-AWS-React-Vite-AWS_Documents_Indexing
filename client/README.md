## Structure and workflow

The client app uses Vite for serving the React app with grouped and structured components, separate configurations. The authentication is managed by storing the user's email in local storage. The possible change to the authentication process is to switch to storing the JWT and partial user's data instead.

## Installation

The client app uses `npm` as the package manager.

```shell
npm install
```

## Running the project

The application connects to Supabase by creating client with provided env variables, as well as requests data from `api` Edge Function by axios fetches.

Run the script to start the app in development:

```shell
$ npm run dev
```

Set up the `.env` with variables as shown in `.env.example`. For deployment, set the environment variables directly or using other tools in the app's root.
